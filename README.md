Clean Events
============

A WordPress plugin to handle events in a clean and minimalist fashion. This plugin is designed to handle events using native WordPress tables, custom post types, taxonomies, etc. This will eventually be a plugin that will offer a simple and clean way to handle events without polluting your database with custom tables or rendering bloated templates in the view.

When this is done it will focus on a sexy minimalistic design approach that will use CLNDR.js on the front end, while giving users the benefits of the WordPress CMS. There will be an admin interface that allows the end user to add their own custom fields to their events, widgets, shortcode, integration with Google Maps API, iCal, and hopefully more.

Please... if you know how to code then help contribute! This is going to take me a lot longer than it needs to without the help of other developers. The plan is to make this be extremely friendly to developers with as many filters and actions to hook in as possible. Let's write this correctly and make it simple for developers to use and modify!
